A simple doxc/pdf to image converter using: 

- Python  # Used for logic 
- Js      # Communcation between Front-end and Back-end / And Front-end
- HTML    # Front-end
- Css     # Front-end


I wanted to try to make a simple Electron-like program with some functionality behind it. 
That's why I used Python which I'm most comfortable with and the eel library since it is easy to use.

I also wanted to expand my knowladge of HTML, Css and js.
